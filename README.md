# API documentation

- [Documentation for the master branch](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/docs/pages/versions/unversioned/sdk/appcenter.md)
- [Documentation for the latest stable release](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/appcenter/)

# Installation in managed Expo projects

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

#### Prerequisites:

- App project using Expo SDK 41+.
- Installed `expo-cli@4.4.4` or later.
- Installed `appcenter` JavaScript libraries:

```sh
yarn add appcenter appcenter-analytics appcenter-crashes
```

#### With `expo install`

```
expo install expo-appcenter
```

#### Without `expo install`

```sh
# using yarn
yarn add expo-appcenter

# using npm
npm install expo-appcenter
```

Open your `app.json` and update your `plugins` section (`expo install` would do it for you):

```json
{
  "plugins": ["expo-appcenter"]
}
```

The plugin needs to know the location of your app's [Appcenter Config files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/getting-started/react-native#312-integrate-react-native-android) generated by Appcenter. By default, it searches for them in `<project-root>/appcenter` folder.
